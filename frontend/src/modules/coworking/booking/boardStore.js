 * The board's single source of truth.

 * cabin list. State persists to localStorage, which is what makes the board
 * behave like a system rather than a demo: onboard a client, reload, they are
 * still in the cabin.
 *
 * This is deliberately the shape a server would return. When the API is wired
 * up, `loadBoard` becomes a fetch and each case here becomes one endpoint - the
 * action names below are the endpoint list.
 *
 * NOTE: the existing backend models occupancy per seat (a seat ledger on the
 * cabin, with cabin status derived from it). This board is cabin-level: a cabin
 * is let whole and has a capacity. That difference has to be settled before
 * wiring, or the two will disagree about what "booked" means.
