/*
 * Authorisation is the parent router's, deliberately.
 *
 * /coworking already gates every request on being allowed to use the booking
 * board page, and maps the method to a page action - GET needs view, PUT needs
 * edit. That is exactly the question here: this is the booking board's own
 * state, not the cabin admin CRUD.
 *
 * This previously also demanded cabins.view / cabins.update, which only
 * COWORKING_ADMIN and MANAGER hold by default. The executives who actually work
 * this board all day got 403 on every save, so the board fell back to
 * localStorage and each machine quietly kept its own floor - the exact bug the
 * server copy was added to fix.
