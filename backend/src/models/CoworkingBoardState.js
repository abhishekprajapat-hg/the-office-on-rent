/*
 * The booking board, stored for the whole company.
 *
 * The board was built client-side and kept its floor in one browser's
 * localStorage, which meant every machine had a different set of bookings and
 * an admin could not see any of them. This holds that same state on the server
 * so there is one copy of it.
 *
 * The state is stored as the board already shapes it rather than being split
 * across the cabin/contract/invoice models. Those model occupancy per seat and
 * bill off contracts; the board lets a cabin whole and bills nothing. Mapping
 * between the two is a real piece of work, and doing it badly would put wrong
 * numbers into invoicing - which is worse than the board being separate, which
 * it already is today. What this fixes is the part that is losing data: the
 * floor now lives somewhere every device and every admin can read.
 *
 * `version` exists because two people work this board at once. A save carrying
 * a stale version is refused rather than quietly overwriting the other
 * person's booking.
